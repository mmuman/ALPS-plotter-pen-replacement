# Description

This 3D-printed kit allows using *Bic 4-colors* pens or recharges as stylus for ALPS-based printers like the MCP-40.

It compries four color holders, two extra holders (in case one breaks, or for other colors), a cutting jig, a bent paperclip to help extract the ink tube from the holder.

# Usage

## Prerequisites

- cutter or exoknife or other sharp blade
- hot-glue gun to seal the remainder of the ink tube
- gloves or a good soap for the ink spills

## Setup from complete ink tube

TODO



## Refill from cut ink tube leftover

(untested) It is possible to reuse the ball assembly and the rest of the unused ink tube for refill several times.

TODO

Then proceed to setup as with a complete ink tube.
