# ALPS plotter pen replacements kit CAD files

3D-printable holder and cutting kit to replace ALPS plotter pens, which are becoming rare and expensive. These allow using cheap *Bic 4-colors* ball-pens instead. For use in MCP-40 (ORIC, Sega/Yenoâ€¦) and other similar printers.

Designed in OpenSCAD.

License isn't chosen yet.

## User manual

TODO: User manual is (soon) available in [English](manual_en.md), [French](manual_fr.md).

## Oredering pre-made kits

TODO:

Since the required precision is similar to that of regular 3D printers and may need several tries, you may want to order calibrated pieces instead.


## OpenSCAD files

TODO: publish them

- [alps_plotter_pen.scad](alps_plotter_pen.scad): The pen holder itself, where the ink tube is fitted.
- [alps_plotter_pen_cutting_jig.scad](alps_plotter_pen_cutting_jig.scad): A small tool to help with cutting the ink tube to the exact length and  verify the assembly size.

## TODO

- [ ] test with SLA printing
- [ ] choose licence
- [ ] publish CAD files proper here
- [ ] publish on Thingiverse
